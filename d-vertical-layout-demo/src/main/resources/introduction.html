<hr />
<p>Two windows demonstrates how <code>DynamicVerticalLayout</code> can be used to fix overlapping content. 
<ul>
<li>On the left <code>Window</code>, we have a regular VerticalLayout with three <code>Label</code>s in it.</li> 
<li>On the right <code>Window</code>, we have the same structure but inside of <code>DynamicVerticalLayout</code>.</li>
</ul> 
Both layouts sets expand ratio to 1.0 for the label in the middle. 
<code>DynamicVerticalLayout</code> paints the slot's background with green color 
when dynamic min-height calculation is enabled for the slot's component.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Click on any label to change it's properties. A property editor Window will appear. 
If you have a deeper layout hierarchy, there will appear a new property Window for each one 
starting from the bottom layout and ending to the top Label.
